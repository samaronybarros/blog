Hi everyone,

Allow me to introduce myself, I'm Samarony Barros, also known as Sam Barros. As a Senior Software Engineer originally from Brazil, I've recently embarked on a journey in Germany. The decision to live abroad has been both challenging and rewarding, filled with remarkable experiences that I'm excited to share with you.

Like many developers, I've encountered my fair share of coding challenges in my day-to-day work. And what's the first instinct when faced with such issues?

Google it! ðŸ™Œ

A simple search on Google often leads to valuable insights and solutions. I'm immensely grateful for the vibrant IT communities I've stumbled upon throughout my tech career; they've been invaluable resources. In light of this, I've made the decision to give back by sharing my experiences, insights, and solutions with fellow developers. From tackling coding hurdles to providing tutorials, I aim to shed light on the intricacies of software development. Additionally, I'll offer glimpses into life as a developer in Europe, exploring the nuances of being an engineer in this dynamic landscape. Moreover, I'll delve into the tools that streamline our development processes, including Docker, Buildkite, and our trusted companion, GitHub, among others.

Furthermore, I'm keen on providing solutions to exercises from platforms like Codility and HackerRank, offering practical insights into problem-solving and algorithmic challenges.

Are there any specific tools or topics you'd like me to explore? Your input is invaluable, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments section.

Let's embark on this journey together, navigating the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering.
